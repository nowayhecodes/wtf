## WTF

A blazing fast command-line tool that automatically detects errors in previously executed console commands, suggests corrections, and provides an option to re-execute the corrected commands.

### Features

- üöÄ **Blazing Fast**: Reads only the last command from history without scanning the entire file
- üéØ **Smart Suggestions**: Provides intelligent corrections for common typos and mistakes
- üîÑ **Quick Re-execution**: Re-run corrected commands with a simple confirmation
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Define your own correction rules via configuration
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe**: Asks for confirmation before executing any corrected command
- üîå **Shell Support**: Works with bash, zsh, and other common shells

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/nowayhecodes/wtf@latest
```

Or quickly install using the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nowayhecodes/wtf/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Usage

$ gti status
git: command not found

$ wtf
Did you mean: git status? [Y/n] y
# Executes: git status
```

# Executes: grep "pattern" file.txt
